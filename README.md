# RFVision

## Introduction
RFVision is an open-source toolbox for robot vision. It is a part of the [RobotFlow](https://wenqiangx.github.io/robotflowproject/) project.

The project takes a lot of design ideas from the great project [mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv), [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection), [MMDetection3D](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d), but with significant modifications to adapt to robot vision tasks. For pure 2D or 3D vision tasks, we recommend to use MMDetection/3D as they support more baselines. 

But for robot vision where real-time visual servo, multi-modal perception are of more interest, RFVision is the project for you.

## Installation
Please refer to [get_started.md](docs/get_started.md) for installation

## Contributing
We appreciate all contributions to improve RFVision. Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/contributing.md) for the contributing guideline.

## Ackowledgement
We borrow many design from projects in OpenMMLab, we appreciate their efforts on lowering the research bar of computer vision.

When the era of robot learning comes, we wish our toolbox and benchmark could serve the growing research community by providing a flexible toolkit to reimplement existing methods and develop their own new methods.
